            - Change from the use of "part" to refer to each .pod file for the
                tutorial in favor of the more intuitive word "chapter."  "Part" 
                was just to ambiguous (e.g., does "prior part" refer to the prior 
                .pod file or the prior section in the current .pod file).

                the tutorial (all code and examples updated and tested to match)
            - Removed Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL from Authorization.pod
                in favor of a "chained and model-based" approach
